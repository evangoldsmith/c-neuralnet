# Simple Neural Network Implemented in Plain C
My take on a simple multi layer perceptron, based of Andrej Kaparthy's explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&t=6443s).
Features customizable hyperparameters and options (e.g. layer structure, learning rate, data set and training). 

## Running
To build and start the project simply clone the repo and run the following in the project directory.
```
make
```
